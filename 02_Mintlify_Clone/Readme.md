## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3

### Constraints

- No JavaScript
- No TailwindCSS or CSS frameworks
- No AI usage (hardest, MDN Docs are not that fun to read :)
- No animations or fancy effects
- Desktop-only layout (no responsiveness)

## Fonts Used

Fonts were extracted directly from the CSS:

- **Primary Font:** Inter
- **Secondary Font:** Monospace: Used for labels, tags, and small UI metadata

## Color Palette

Colors are defined using modern CSS color functions and match the reference design closely.

- **Primary Text Color:** `lab(2.42579% -.165291 -.470081)`
- **Muted Text:** `lab(2.42579% -.165291 -.470081 / 0.8)`
- **Accent / Brand Color:** `lab(51.3415% -41.5657 15.3527)`
- **Background Tints:**  
  `lab(2.42579% -.165291 -.470081 / 0.03)`  
  `lab(2.42579% -.165291 -.470081 / 0.05)`
- **Base Colors:** `#08090a`, black, white
